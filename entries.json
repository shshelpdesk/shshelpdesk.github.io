If this occurs, hold the power button down for 30 seconds, release it, and then press it again. The computer should restart with a cleaned cache, and will be able to access the network. However, if the issues persist, please feel welcome to visit the Student Help Desk, located in the Library."},"3": {"title": "Adding a Printer", "body": "If you need to print something, but are unable to find any printers you are able to print to, you may need to add those printers. But before we do this, it is important to know that there are only three printers available to students at this time: One in the Career Center, one in Room 110, and one in the Library. Now, to add a printer, press the Windows Key and search for "Add Printer". You should see a printer with a green plus sign on top of it. Click it, wait for the program to open. You will either see a folder labled "High Schools" or two folders denoting the names of different high schools. Which ever the case, navigate to the folder labled "Sehome High School" or something similar. There, you will find different tabs denoting different areas of the school: One for the main building, the other for the Library. Navigate to the level with the printer you would like to install, and then locate said printer on the floor plan that should appear when the level-tab is clicked. Click the printer, and select "Install Drivers". This process should take about 1-2 minutes, and take about 1-2 minutes to go into effect. You should now be able to print your desired item from your desired destination."}}
